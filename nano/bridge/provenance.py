"""Optional Protocol-C provenance adapter for the risk-gate bridge.

This is a **host-integration concern, not a language feature**. A `.nano`
strategy author has no syntax that reaches this module and no way to invoke
or bypass it — it wraps whatever ``DecisionGate`` a host platform hands to
``NanoBridge``, entirely outside the IR and the compiler. Nano's contract
(strategies propose, gates decide) already gives every decision a recorded
reason; this module lets a production deployment additionally bind that
decision to a non-repudiable, tamper-evident signature via Protocol-C
(https://github.com/DBarr3/PROTOCOL-C) — useful wherever a decision needs
to be provable to a third party after the fact, not just logged for
internal debugging.

Requires the optional ``aether-protocol-c`` package
(``pip install aether-protocol-c``, or this project's ``provenance`` extra).
Constructing ``ProvenanceGate`` without it installed raises
``ProtocolCUnavailable`` with install instructions — it never silently
degrades to unsigned logging.

Determinism note: wrapping a ``DecisionGate`` here does not break bit-identical
replay of a ``BridgeResult`` (Milestone 5's acceptance test). The returned
``Decision`` is the inner engine's decision, unchanged; the signature and
audit-log entry are a side channel the bridge never sees. Those side-channel
records carry a real wall-clock timestamp and fresh entropy by design — that
is what makes a receipt trustworthy evidence of *when* a decision happened,
as opposed to a deterministic replay artifact.

See ``docs/internal-protocol-c-integration.md`` for where a production
deployment would actually wire this in, and ``examples/provenance_signing_demo.py``
for a runnable walkthrough.
